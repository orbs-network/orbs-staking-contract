/**
 * Orbs Staking Smart Contract
 * 
 * IMPORTANT:
 *   Staking must be done only using the contract interface functions.
 *   Never transfer tokens directly to the contract address.
 *   Tokens transferred directly to the contract cannot be recovered. 
 *
 * Main interface functions:
 *   stake(uint256 _amount) - stakes ORBS tokens on behalf of msg.sender. 
 *   Assumes that the user has already approved at least the required amount 
 *   using ERC20 approve.
 * 
 *   unstake(uint256 _amount) - Unstakes ORBS tokens from msg.sender. 
 *   If successful, this will start the cooldown period, after which
 *   sg.sender would be able to withdraw all of his tokens.
 * 
 *   withdraw() - requests to withdraw all of the ORBS tokens of 
 *   msg.sender that completed the cooldown period.
